## Usage

### Prerequisites
The addin is based on the `NDepend.Console` command line tool. Before using it, make sure the NDepend installation location is part of the environment variable `PATH`, and you have a valid license.

### Including the addin

To include the addin, add the following to the beginning of the `cake` script:
```
#addin "Cake.NDepend"
```

### Use the addin

To use the addin, you need to configure the settings and run the `NDepend.Console` alias:
```
#addin "Cake.NDepend"
...
Task("NDepend-Analyse")
    .Description("Runs the NDepend analyser on the project.")
    .Does(() => 
    {
        var settings = new NDependSettings
        {
            ProjectPath = ndependProjectFullPath // Full path to the NDepend project.
        };

        NDependAnalyse(settings);
    });
...
```

### Settings

The `NDependSettings` have *one* mandatory option, `ProjectPath`. The remain options are optional, however, there are certain option combinations that need to be used together. For more information about the usage read the `NDepend.Console` [documentation](https://www.ndepend.com/docs/ndepend-console).
